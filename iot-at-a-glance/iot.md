##1. Definition
 Internet of thing is internet of thing. There two main component is internet
and thing. For a long time, internet is the place where people communicate,
share data. The data sending from client device and that data come to sever then
server transmit the data further. So internet is made up of three major people,
client, server. And now new major is added to and it is thing.
It is an object that has sensor attach to it. So it can transmit data futher up into
the internet into the cloud where it can be analyzed and use to make a desition
base on that data.
####Example
* The system that determine the quality of air in Ha Noi.
* Smart traffic
* Heart monitor
 
##2. Connectivity Model
 There are 4 IOT connectivity models: device to device, device to cloud,
device to gateway, backend data sharing
###2.1.1 Device-to-Device
 Device-to-device communication represents two or more devices that directly connect and communicate between one another. They can communicate over many types of networks, including IP networks or the Internet, but most often use protocols like Bluetooth, Z-Wave, and ZigBee.

                         

###2.1.2 Usage
 This model is commonly used in home automation systems to transfer small data packets of information between devices at a relatively low data rate.  This could be light bulbs, thermostats, and door locks sending small amounts of information to each other. Each connectivity model has different characteristics. With Device-to-Device, he said “security is specifically simplified because you have these short-range radio technology [and a] one-to-one relationship between these two devices.” Device-to-device is popular among wearable IoT devices like a heart monitor paired to a smartwatch where data doesn’t necessarily have be to shared with multiple people.
 
###2.2.1 Device to cloud
 Device-to-cloud communication involves an IoT device connecting directly to an Internet cloud service like an application service provider to exchange data and control message traffic. It often uses traditional wired Ethernet or Wi-Fi connections, but can also use cellular technology.

              
                        
###2.2.2 Usage
 A use case for cellular-based Device-to-Cloud would be a smart tag that tracks your dog while you’re not around, which would need wide-
area cellular communication because you wouldn’t know where the dog might be.
Another scenario, Tschofenig said, would be remote monitoring with a product like the Dropcam, where you need the bandwidth provided by Wifi or Ethernet. But it also makes sense to push data into the cloud in this scenario because makes sense because it provides access to the
user if they’re away. “Specifically, if you’re away and you want to see what’s on your webcam at home. You contact the cloud infrastructure
and then the cloud infrastructure relays to your IoT device.”
                                           
###2.3.1 Device to gateway
 In the Device-to-Gateway model, IoT devices basically connect to an intermediary device to access a cloud service. This model often
involves application software operating on a local gateway device (like a smartphone or a “hub”) that acts as an intermediary between an IoT
device and a cloud service.
This gateway could provide security and other functionality such as data or protocol translation. If the application-layer gateway is a
smartphone, this application software might take the form of an app that pairs with the IoT device and communicates with a cloud service.
               

###2.3.2 Usage
 You connect all your devices up to that gateway and it does something like data aggregation or transcoding, and it either hands [off the data] locally to the home or shuffles it off to the cloud, depending on the use case.Gateway devices can also potentially bridge the interoperability gap between devices that communicate on different standards. For instance, SmartThings’ Z-Wave and Zigbee transceivers can communicate with both families of devices.
 
###2.4.1 Back-End Data-Sharing 
 Back-End Data-Sharing essentially extends the single device-to- cloud communication model so that IoT devices and sensor data can be
accessed by authorized third parties. Under this model, users can export and analyze smart object data from a cloud service in combination with data from other sources, and send it to other services for aggregation and  analysis.
